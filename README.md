_**Description of the Problem:**_

Nowadays, it has become a trend to track your macros and track recipes made when trying to stay healthy. However, it is hard to keep track of what foods provide what benefits. It also has become an issue to find recipes that actually taste good and provide benefits. The problem lies in not having a central place to store your weekly goals, recipes, and a way to track your statistics.

**_Description of NutriFlow:_**

NutriFlow is a web application that is designed to help students plan meals, manage recipes, and track healthy eating habits. One of the main features is to have a weekly display of the planned out meals which will then have a total count of the calories and other macros tracked according to whichever recipe was added during the day. There will also be a section to create, add, and save recipes to the user's profile and then use those said recipes to apply to the planner. In this way, all planned recipes will be in a centralized location and all the macros will already be inputted in the recipes' description, in this way this is an app that will do all the tiresome calculations to make sure you are on track with your goals. Whether you hit your goal or not will be presented via a progress bar found in the home page of the app. If the said user is looking for inspiration for their next cookup, there is a feed that presents other users' recipes and shows nearby restaurants. 

_**Buidling our App:**_

Built in TypeScript using the Next.js framework with a Node.js backend, the app stores data in a SQL PostgreSQL database. 
The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS, and the visual layout is designed in Figma. Possible Future components 
include social features such as adding friends, viewing others meals. Additional health tools like calorie calculators, daily 
and per‑meal calorie tracking, weight goals, along with Google Maps and API integrations for locating gyms and grocery stores may be added. 
We’re aiming to create a complete and fun experience that helps users work on themselves, stay motivated, and enjoy building healthier habits.

_**Brainstorming ideas:**_
Add friends feature, see others meals,
google maps to add local gyms, stores, calculator for calories
in profile add weight show maitenance of calories, add weight goals,
show the number of calories per meal, adding the calories per day
streaks features, share streaks with people, share status with friends,
google api, strava idea = makes posts => feed of food 
use mongodb, with typescript, tailwind css, nodejs with nextjs
