Description of Web Application:
NutriFlow is a web application designed to help students plan meals, manage recipes, and track healthy eating habits. 
Built in TypeScript using the Next.js framework with a Node.js backend, the app stores data in a SQL PostgreSQL database. 
The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS, and the visual layout is designed in Figma. Possible Future components 
include social features such as adding friends, viewing others meals. Additional health tools like calorie calculators, daily 
and per‑meal calorie tracking, weight goals, along with Google Maps and API integrations for locating gyms and grocery stores may be added. 
We’re aiming to create a complete and fun experience that helps users work on themselves, stay motivated, and enjoy building healthier habits.
